An agentic AI system that performs real-time financial research, market analysis, and competitor reconnaissance to deliver actionable investment verdicts.

The Problem: Retail investors are overwhelmed by data. Static analysis tools (like standard RAG) rely on outdated documents, while manual research takes hours of cross-referencing news, stock tickers, and financial reports.

The Solution: Stratagem AI is not a chatbot; it is an Autonomous Agent. Unlike standard LLMs, it has "agency"—the ability to create a research plan, execute it using external tools, and synthesize the results into a professional dossier.
